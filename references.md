## Things that provide for interesting further reading

- [CSS Tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/) - because I want to know more about the CSS property `-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio` as well as the difference between it and `-webkit-device-pixel-ratio`. And also why the former only applies to iPhone...?
